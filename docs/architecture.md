# Architecture

This is a single-process Nest application (plus one optional sidecar
worker process). It exists to demonstrate how
[`nest-drizzle-native`](https://github.com/nest-native/nest-drizzle-native)
and
[`nest-trpc-native`](https://github.com/nest-native/nest-trpc-native)
compose under realistic backend pressure: feature modules, multi-tenant
context, cross-service transactions, post-commit side effects via a
transactional outbox, and a typed tRPC client.

This document is meant to be read top-to-bottom in one focused sitting.
Each section answers one question.

## The problem this exists to solve

If you're starting a new NestJS backend and you've picked Drizzle for the
database and tRPC for the API layer, you have a **composition problem**.
Each library is well-documented in isolation — but a real backend is the
composition, and the composition is where most of the design decisions
live. Library docs cover their slice; nobody covers the seams.

This app is the seams, written out. Specifically, it commits to a
decision for each of the following questions that an adopter would
otherwise have to answer from scratch:

- **How does "current user" and "current organization" thread through
  everything?** Express middleware sets `req.authContext` on the way in.
  That value reaches a tRPC procedure via
  `TrpcModule.forRoot({ createContext })`, reaches a guard via
  `context.getArgs()[1]`, and reaches a service three calls deep via a
  request-scoped `CURRENT_USER` / `CURRENT_ORGANIZATION` provider in
  `RequestContextModule`. One auth middleware, four consumers, one
  shape. See [Request lifecycle](#request-lifecycle) and
  [Authentication](#authentication).

- **How does a transaction span services?** "Insert a user, insert a
  membership, insert a project, write an audit row, enqueue a side
  effect" is one business operation. Splitting it across services would
  normally either leak the tx through every method signature or leak
  the lack of one. `@nestjs-cls/transactional` keeps the active
  transaction in CLS, and every repo that participates injects the
  Drizzle client via `@InjectTransaction()` so it transparently uses
  the tx client inside a `@Transactional()` method and the raw client
  outside one. **There is one trap with `better-sqlite3`**: the
  driver is synchronous, so the `@Transactional()` method must be too —
  the official adapter (>=1.3.0) auto-detects this and runs the
  transaction in sync mode. See
  [Synchronous better-sqlite3 transactions](#synchronous-better-sqlite3-transactions).

- **How do you send a post-commit side effect without losing it?** You
  can't send the email inside the transaction (rollback → ghost email)
  and you can't send it from the request handler after the transaction
  either (process crashes → lost email). The transactional outbox is
  the answer. Implementing it correctly means getting the claim
  atomicity, idempotency, exponential backoff, and stuck-claim recovery
  right. See [Outbox](#outbox) and [The worker process](#the-worker-process).

- **How do you keep the typed-client contract honest?** tRPC promises
  end-to-end type safety, but only if the generated `AppRouter` actually
  round-trips into a real client at CI time. This app's
  [`client-smoke/`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/client-smoke/client.ts)
  workspace imports the generated `AppRouter`, boots the app in-process,
  and runs one query + one mutation + one auth-protected call against a
  live local server. `client-smoke:typecheck` is in `npm run ci`.

- **What does the boring scaffolding actually look like?** ESLint flat
  config with a cognitive-complexity ceiling of 15, `drizzle-kit`
  forward-only migrations, `node:test` + `c8` coverage, an `npm run ci`
  chain (`typecheck → lint → complexity → tests → audit → build`), a
  Dockerfile that runs both API and worker off the same image. All of
  it is in the repo from milestone 1, not added as an afterthought.

The point isn't that these are the only good answers. The point is that
**this app commits to specific answers**, so you can disagree with any
one of them and swap it out — but you're disagreeing with something
concrete rather than designing in a vacuum.

## Module graph

              └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The two libraries are wired exactly once each, via their primary `forRoot`
APIs:

- [`src/database/database.module.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/src/database/database.module.ts) →
  `DrizzleModule.forRoot({ schema, connection, shutdown })`.
- [`src/trpc/trpc.module.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/src/trpc/trpc.module.ts) →
  `TrpcModule.forRoot<AppTrpcContext>({ path, autoSchemaFile,
  createContext })`.

Feature modules declare their repositories via
`DrizzleModule.forFeature([…])` and their routers as providers. Routers are
ordinary `@Injectable()` classes (the `@Router('alias')` decorator from
`nest-trpc-native` applies `@Injectable()` automatically) — they accept
service deps through `@Inject(...)` in the constructor and call them.

## Request lifecycle

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ HTTP request    │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         v
  AuthMiddleware (express)              extracts Bearer token, verifies
         │                              via AuthService.resolve(), sets
         │                              req.authContext = { user, org }
         v
  ┌──────────────────────┐
  │ HTTP controller      │   ←── HealthController (no auth)
  │   - or -             │
  │ tRPC handler         │   ←── nest-trpc-native dispatch
  │   AuthGuard          │       reads ctx.authContext via getArgs()[1]
  │   ParamDecorators    │       @Input, @TrpcContext, @CurrentUser
  │   Procedure body     │
  └──────────────────────┘
         │
         v
  Service (request-scoped if it injects CURRENT_USER / CURRENT_ORGANIZATION)
         │
         v
  Repository (singleton; @InjectDrizzle for non-tx services,
              @InjectTransaction for any service that runs inside a
              @Transactional boundary so the active tx is honored)
```

The `AuthMiddleware` runs *before* the tRPC handler because tRPC is mounted
on top of Express. The middleware does the work once; both REST controllers
and tRPC procedures consume the same `authContext` shape.

`@CurrentUser()` and `@CurrentOrganization()` are param decorators that
read `authContext` from either `getArgs()[1]` (the tRPC context object,
populated by `TrpcModule.forRoot({ createContext })`) or
`switchToHttp().getRequest()` (the Express request). One implementation
serves both transports.

## Authentication

`AuthService.login(email, password)` runs `scrypt`-verify against the stored
hash, finds the first membership row for the user, and mints a real
HS256-signed JWT containing `{ sub: userId, org: orgId, iat, exp }`. The
signing key comes from `AUTH_SECRET` (min 32 chars, required in production,
deterministic dev fallback elsewhere).

JWT verification uses Node's built-in `node:crypto` HMAC — there's no JWT
library dependency. See
[`src/auth/jwt.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/src/auth/jwt.ts) for the ~50-line implementation;
the test [`test/integration/auth-jwt.spec.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/test/integration/auth-jwt.spec.ts)
covers roundtrip, tamper, expiry, wrong-secret, malformed, and unsupported-algorithm cases.

Password hashing is `scrypt` with a 16-byte random salt; format is
`scrypt$<salt-hex>$<hash-hex>`. The same helpers are reused by
[`scripts/seed.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/scripts/seed.ts) so seeded users can log in.

## Login lockout

The auth flow is hardened with [`@nest-native/lockout`](https://github.com/nest-native/lockout)
(the `@authlock/core` engine). `AuthService.login` gates **before** the
credential check: `lockout.check({ email, ip })` throws a 429 (mapped by
`@nest-native/trpc` to `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`) when either the email or the
source IP has crossed `LOCKOUT_LIMIT` failures; otherwise a failed
verification calls `reportFailure` and a success calls `reportSuccess`.
The counters live in a Drizzle table (`lockout_attempts`) on the same SQLite
database, written on the base connection — deliberately outside the request
transaction, so a failed attempt is recorded even when the login transaction
rolls back. Because tRPC carries no HTTP body for a guard to inspect, the
integration uses `LockoutService` in the handler rather than `LockoutGuard`
— the library's documented non-HTTP-transport recipe. See
[`src/auth/lockout.setup.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/src/auth/lockout.setup.ts)
and [`test/e2e/auth-lockout.spec.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/test/e2e/auth-lockout.spec.ts)
(N failures → 429; the correct password is refused while locked).

## Read caching

Expensive reads are cached with [`@nest-native/cache`](https://github.com/nest-native/cache)
(the `@stalefree/core` engine) at the **router seam** — the services stay
synchronous and cache-free. `projects.list/get` and `activity.list` wrap
their loaders with org-scoped keys and **tags**; mutations invalidate by tag:
`projects.create` evicts the org's project tag, and `ActivityService.record`
— the projection write site — evicts the project's feed tag, so the
event-driven feed invalidates its own cache the moment the handler writes a
row. Every entry carries a TTL (`CACHE_TTL_MS`, default 30s) as the delivery
backstop. In the default single-process profile the L1 is coherent by
definition; when the worker runs as a separate process, `CACHE_SOCKET_PATH`
wires `@stalefree/core/socket`'s unix-socket bus across the split. See
[`src/cache/cache.setup.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/src/cache/cache.setup.ts)
and [`test/e2e/stalefree-cache.spec.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/test/e2e/stalefree-cache.spec.ts)
(a ten-minute TTL makes any missed invalidation glaring — freshness within
seconds proves the tags did the work, not expiry).

## The central transactional workflow

Brief §7's "single proof": `users.invite` writes across **five tables**
inside one `@Transactional()` method and queues a post-commit side effect.
The method is on
[`OrganizationOnboardingService`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/src/modules/onboarding/organization-onboarding.service.ts):

```
@Transactional()
inviteUser(input): Promise<Result> {
  1. upsert  users           (user)
  2. insert  memberships     (membership)
  3. insert  projects        (project)
  4. insert  audit_events    ("user.invited")
  5. insert  outbox_events   (topic: "user.invited", idempotency_key)
}
```

The whole method runs inside one SQLite transaction because:

- `AppModule` registers `ClsPluginTransactional` with the official
  `@nestjs-cls/transactional-adapter-drizzle-orm`.
- Every repo/service used inside the method injects the Drizzle client via
  `@InjectTransaction()` (the CLS proxy) instead of `@InjectDrizzle()` (the
  raw client). When the `@Transactional()` decorator enters the wrapper,
  the proxy resolves to the per-tx client; outside the wrapper it resolves
  to the raw client. The repo never sees the difference.

### Synchronous better-sqlite3 transactions

`better-sqlite3` is a **synchronous** driver: its `client.transaction(fn)`
runs `fn` synchronously and rejects a callback that returns a `Promise` (an
async wrapper would commit an empty tx and run the writes *after* commit,
against a closed tx). So a `@Transactional()` method on `better-sqlite3`
must itself be synchronous — no `async`, no `await`.

The official `@nestjs-cls/transactional-adapter-drizzle-orm` (>=1.3.0)
handles this automatically: its `transactionMode` defaults to `'auto'`,
detects the synchronous driver, and runs the transaction in sync mode
(force it with `transactionMode: 'sync'` if auto-detection ever misses).
Async drivers — libsql, Postgres, MySQL — keep working unchanged, so no
code has to change when you switch.

> Historical note: before 1.3.0 the official adapter only supported async
> drivers, so this app shipped a ~30-line `SyncDrizzleTransactionalAdapter`
> workaround. That fix is now upstream
> ([nestjs-cls#572](https://github.com/Papooch/nestjs-cls/pull/572)) and the
> workaround has been removed.

### Rollback safety, exactly-once delivery

Three §7-mandatory tests in
[`test/integration/invite-user.workflow.spec.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/test/integration/invite-user.workflow.spec.ts):

- **Happy path:** all five rows persisted; outbox row visible after commit;
  worker tick processes it; `FakeEmailTransport` records the email.
- **Rollback safety:** force a throw between project insert and audit
  event; assert zero rows from this transaction persist; assert no email.
- **Worker crash recovery:** seed an outbox row with `status='processing'`
  and stale `claimed_at`; the next claimer tick re-claims it (under the
  stuck-timeout), processes it exactly once, and a follow-up tick is a
  no-op.

## Outbox

Schema is at
[`src/database/schema/outbox-events.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/src/database/schema/outbox-events.ts)
and matches brief §8: `pending | processing | completed | failed` status
machine, partial-unique `idempotency_key`, `(status, available_at)` claim
index, attempts/maxAttempts counters with backoff.

The flow has three pieces:

| Piece | File | Job |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Producer | [`outbox-producer.service.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/src/modules/outbox/outbox-producer.service.ts) | `enqueue({ topic, payload, idempotencyKey? })` — inserts a `pending` row inside the active tx |
| Registry | [`outbox-registry.service.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/src/modules/outbox/outbox-registry.service.ts) | `register(topic, handler)` — handler module init binds itself |
| Claimer | [`outbox-claimer.service.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/src/modules/outbox/outbox-claimer.service.ts) | `tick()` — atomic claim (pending OR stuck processing), dispatch, mark completed/retry/failed |

The `user.invited` topic has exactly one handler
([`user-invited.handler.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/src/modules/outbox/user-invited.handler.ts))
that delegates to `FakeEmailTransport`. In a real app, swap the transport
for SES, Sendgrid, etc.

## The worker process

[`scripts/start-worker.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/scripts/start-worker.ts) boots a headless
Nest application context, resolves `OutboxClaimer` from DI, and ticks on
`OUTBOX_POLL_MS` (default 2s). `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` abort an
`AbortController` that interrupts the in-flight wait, lets the current
tick drain, and closes the Nest container.

The loop body is exported as `runWorkerLoop(claimer, config)` so tests
exercise it without spawning child processes.

In production, run the API and the worker as two separate processes off the
same image (see `docker-compose.yml`).

## Layout (`src/`)

| Path | What's here |
| --- | --- |
| `main.ts` | Nest bootstrap — listens on `PORT` |
| `app.module.ts` | Root module: imports + ClsPluginTransactional wiring |
| `config/env.ts` | `loadEnv()` — single source of truth for env vars |
| `database/` | `DatabaseModule` (DrizzleModule.forRoot wiring), schema, migrations |
| `auth/` | JWT helpers, scrypt password helpers, `AuthService`, middleware, `AuthGuard`, `@CurrentUser`/`@CurrentOrganization` decorators, `AuthRouter` |
| `context/` | `RequestContextModule` — Nest request-scoped `CURRENT_USER` / `CURRENT_ORGANIZATION` providers backed by `req.authContext` |
| `health/` | `/health` REST controller |
| `modules/organizations/` | Repo + service + tRPC router. `organizations.current` / `.list` |
| `modules/users/` | Repo + service + tRPC router. `users.me` / `.list` / `.invite` |
| `modules/projects/` | Repo + service + tRPC router. `projects.list` / `.get` / `.create` |
| `modules/memberships/` | Repo only (consumed by onboarding) |
| `modules/audit-log/` | `AuditLogService.record()` |
| `modules/outbox/` | Producer, claimer, registry, fake transport, `user.invited` handler, `outbox.constants.ts` |
| `modules/onboarding/` | `OrganizationOnboardingService` — the `@Transactional` workflow |
| `trpc/` | `AppTrpcModule` (TrpcModule.forRoot wiring), `PingRouter`, `generate-types.ts` |
| `@generated/server.ts` | Auto-generated from the routers (gitignored; regenerated by `npm run trpc:generate`) |

## Tests

| Path | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `test/integration/organizations.smoke.spec.ts` | Migration runs; `organizations` table queryable + unique constraint |
| `test/integration/core-schema.spec.ts` | Insert + constraint behavior for the other five tables |
| `test/integration/seed.spec.ts` | `seedDatabase` is idempotent; password hash is real scrypt |
| `test/integration/auth-jwt.spec.ts` | JWT sign/verify roundtrip, tamper, expiry, wrong-secret, malformed, unsupported alg |
| `test/integration/auth-password.spec.ts` | scrypt hash/verify positive + negative |
| `test/integration/core-schema.spec.ts` | (also) outbox partial-unique on `idempotency_key` |
| `test/integration/invite-user.workflow.spec.ts` | The three §7 tests (happy, rollback, crash recovery) |
| `test/integration/outbox-worker.spec.ts` | Worker loop drains pending; honors abort; survives tick errors |
| `test/e2e/auth-flow.spec.ts` | Login flow over real HTTP; 401 on wrong password / no token / bad token |
| `test/e2e/trpc-ping.smoke.spec.ts` | `GET /trpc/ping` returns 'pong'; `/health` returns ok |
| `test/e2e/core-modules.spec.ts` | Authenticated flow over real HTTP across the three core routers |

Plus `client-smoke/client.ts` (typed client over real HTTP using the
generated `AppRouter`) which is run via `npm run client-smoke` rather than
the test runner. It exercises one query, one mutation, and one
auth-protected call.

## Production deployment recipe

The default storage is `better-sqlite3` — zero-setup local dev. To run a
production deployment on Postgres:

1. Swap `drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3` for `drizzle-orm/node-postgres` (or
   `drizzle-orm/postgres-js`) in
   [`src/database/database.ts`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/src/database/database.ts).
2. Swap `pragma('journal_mode = WAL')` etc. for the Postgres equivalents
   (typically nothing — set search_path if needed).
3. Replace `SyncDrizzleTransactionalAdapter` with the official
   `TransactionalAdapterDrizzleOrm` from
   `@nestjs-cls/transactional-adapter-drizzle-orm`. Postgres is async, so
   the original async-callback shape works.
4. Update the partial unique index on `outbox_events.idempotency_key` if
   the drizzle-kit output for Postgres differs (it usually doesn't for
   this shape).
5. Set `DATABASE_URL=postgres://…` in the environment. The Postgres
   sections in [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/nest-native/reference-app/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) are commented
   for exactly this scenario.

Run API and worker as two processes off the same image:

```bash
# API
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://… \
  -e AUTH_SECRET=… \
  reference-app:latest

# Worker (same image, different command)
docker run --rm \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://… \
  -e AUTH_SECRET=… \
  reference-app:latest node dist/scripts/start-worker.js
```

`docker-compose.yml` wires both as services with healthchecks and a shared
volume; comment out the SQLite path and uncomment the Postgres section to
switch.

## What this app deliberately is not

Re-stating the brief's non-goals because they shape what you should not
add here:

- **Not a CLI** (`create-nest-native-app`). Permanent maintenance cost,
  marginal value vs. a well-organized template repo.
- **Not the home of a standalone outbox package.** The outbox pattern
  lives here as an in-app module. A hypothetical `nest-outbox-native`
  extraction (no such package exists today) is only worth considering
  after three+ real apps independently rewrite the same shape — until
  then, every adopter forks this module's code rather than depending on
  a package.
- **Not a frontend.** The `client-smoke/` workspace is a typed-client
  smoke test, not a UI.
- **Not multi-database / GraphQL / micro-frontends.** Resist scope creep.

If a pattern repeats three times in this app, it's a candidate for one of
the upstream libraries — not for a local helper here.
